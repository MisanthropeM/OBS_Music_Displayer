# OBS_Music_Displayer
Display music informations on auto-scrolling text if it is longer than the width of the box.
This project does not play music, it only reads informations on txt files !

Node.js is required for this to work. Install it here : https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer/current


HOW TO :

Once Node.js is installed and the repository is downloaded, you need to launch the script, either manually or automatically (OBS can launch scripts at startup) : ./run_tests in a cmd prompt

Create a browser source on OBS and put « http://localhost:3000 » as URL.

Couple this with Tuna that put music info in files and you have an automated music info scroller :
